# Stevenson Code â€” Python Translation

This folder contains a faithful Python translation of the C++ program found in `Literature/Stevenson Code.doc`.

What it does:
- Computes diffusion-controlled adsorption and dynamic surface tension (DST)
- Supports spherical (convex) and planar geometries
- Includes five isotherms: Henry, Langmuir, Frumkin, Freundlich, Volmer
- Writes results to a tab-separated file `Simulation.tsv`

## How to run

- Requires Python 3.9+ (standard library only)
- Run the script and follow the interactive prompts:

```powershell
python .\Translation\stevenson_code_translation.py
```

Results will be saved to `Simulation.tsv` in the current working directory (overwritten each run).

## Notes
- The original C++ comments list diffusivity units as `m/s^2`; here we assume standard `m^2/s` for diffusion.
- The numerical method mirrors the original simple bisection routine and fixed time step.
- If spherical geometry is chosen, you will be asked for the radius `rb` as in the original.
