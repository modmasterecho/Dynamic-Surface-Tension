# Development Log

## Project: Dynamic Surface Tension - Ward-Tordai Model Implementation

### Initial Setup - [Date TBD]

#### Project Initialization
- Created basic project structure for Ward-Tordai model implementation
- Set up Python modules for numerical integration and data analysis
- Created testing framework using Jupyter Notebook

#### Files Created
- `Ward_Tordai.py`: Core module for numerical solution of integral equations
- `plotting_and_fitting.py`: Data visualization and model fitting utilities
- `testing.ipynb`: Interactive testing notebook
- `README.md`: Updated with project documentation
- `suggestions.md`: Collection of improvement ideas for measurement device

### Future Development

#### Planned Features
- [ ] Implement numerical integration for Ward-Tordai equation
- [ ] Add support for different surfactant types
- [ ] Implement parameter estimation algorithms
- [ ] Add data import/export functionality
- [ ] Create command-line interface
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Optimize numerical algorithms for performance

#### Known Issues
- None currently

#### Notes
- Consider adding support for different diffusion models
- May need to optimize integration methods for large datasets
- Should validate against published experimental data
